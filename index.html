          Welcome to the Scientific Computing and Propulsion Laboratory at the 
          University of Notre Dame. We will be located in McCourtney Hall as part of the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Department
          (pictured in the background). Our work focuses on developing numerical models of complex fluid flows, 
          with particular emphasis on high-speed reacting flows and combustion. At the core of our research is model development rooted in 
          artificial intelligence (AI), scientific machine learning (SciML), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 
          Across these areas, we rely extensively on high-performance computing and place special emphasis on designing 
          algorithms that exploit extreme scales in both data and computation. Our goal is to harness AI-enabled modeling 
          advances to push the boundaries of design and deepen the physical understanding of next-generation power and propulsion 
          systems across a wide range of devices, including detonation engines, scramjets, and gas turbines. 
          Contact us at <a href="mailto:sbarwey@nd.edu">sbarwey@nd.edu</a> for more information or if you are interested in joining the group.

            <strong>SCPL has a number of projects for which we are actively recruiting PhD students,</strong>
            with a start date for the Fall 2026 term. Project topics include scientific machine
            learning for high-speed reacting flows, in-situ CFD+ML modeling, and AI-based CFD workflow/algorithm design.
            Prospective students should have at least a Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace, Mechanical, or Chemical
            Engineering (or similar), with preferred candidates having a Master’s degree in these disciplines.
